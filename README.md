# ACTL4001 Project

## Project Description

In this case study we look to design a social insurance program for relocation that manages Storslysia's exposure to displacement risk arising from catastrophic climate-related events. We look to mitigate the risks associated with catastrophe-related displacement and exposure to the financial impacts of mass displacement. In this insurance program we will consider both proactive and reactive relocation.

## Assumptions

To simplify the model, we assume that inflation rates follow a normal distribution based on available data.
- GPD assumptions
- Also include further assumptions here.

## Risk Mitigation Considerations

- Considerations...

## Data and Data Limitations

Hazard Event Data:
- 

We understand that inaccurate or biased data could produce inconsistencies in our model. We will explore the data and check for inconsistencies or misrepresented data.

## Key Points

### Constraints
- Our program aims to reduce Storslysia's costs from displacement with a high degree of certainty.
- We aim to prevent costs arising from relocation and prevent exceeding 10% of Storslysia's GDP each year with a degree of certainty.
- Our program must cover all of Storslysia's population.
- Funding models and sources of funding are not in scope.

### Data
- Material and labor costs with housing and relocation increased between 0-50% after weather events. The law limits the price increase to 50% in these situations.
- Replacing household goods ranges from 40% to 75% of housing costs.
- The exchange rate is 1.321.
